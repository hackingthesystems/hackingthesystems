# About Me
<p> Hey, whats up. I am a small developer who just likes to mess around with code. ðŸ˜Š</p>
<p> Chances are you know me from bypassing internet restrictions and breaking free from the dicator-like environment presented in many workplaces, including schools and jobs. </p>
<p>My idea is that the internet was made to be endless, similar to our very own universe, and its unnatural to block it. While some things should be blocked to prevent total abuse and chaos, the current restrictions are over-the-top and just plain idiotic. </p>
